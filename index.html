            <p>This trip was our 400-day anniversary trip and our third trip together. We usually traveled to places in and around Seoul, such as Gangneung, Chuncheon, Donghae, and Incheon. This was our first time visiting a distant place, Busan. Although we could only stay for 2 nights and 3 days, it was our first long-distance trip together and a very happy time with my girlfriend.
                <br><br>

                Both my girlfriend and I love traveling and always try to go on trips frequently. We hardly ever fight, and even if we do, we make up quickly. I think the reason for this is that by traveling often, we take it easy and find happiness together. We resemble each other in this way.
                <br><br>
                In the next chapter, I'll talk about our first trip together after my military discharge, which was also our first overseas trip. Please look forward to the next chapter.</p>

            <h2>Travel to Europe!</h2>
            <p>After being discharged from the military on December 7, 2023, I gave my girlfriend the traditional "flower shoes" and we went on our first overseas trip together. And it was to Europe! We traveled from January 20, 2024, to February 6, 2024, visiting Italy, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.
                <br><Br>
                Now, I will introduce our European trip with photos from the journey!

                    <p>When talking about Rome, you can't miss the Colosseum. As expected, the Colosseum is immensely grand and boasts a rich history.</p>

                    <p>Along with the Colosseum, the Pantheon is also a must-see. It was so crowded that there was hardly any space to step.</p>

                    <p>Florence is also famous for its T-bone steak. We tried it once, and it was reasonably priced and very delicious. Highly recommended!</p>

                    <p>We climbed to the top of the Duomo with my girlfriend, and it wasn't that high. You could see the entire view of Florence, and it was so refreshing and nice.</p>

                    <p>Personally, this was the best and most delicious restaurant of the trip. The restaurant is called "Zaza," and it’s incredibly delicious. Just looking at the photo makes you think it must taste amazing, right?</p>

                    <p>We took a boat in Venice, and it was so refreshing that I wanted to jump into the water. I held back because it was winter.</p>

                This trip marks both my military discharge anniversary and a celebratory journey commemorating 1300 days spent together. It's our first time venturing beyond Korea, and being able to travel to Europe was a dream come true. Sharing my inaugural European expedition with my girlfriend filled me with immense joy and happiness. 
                <br><br>
                Although we couldn't visit countries like France, England, or Spain this time, I'm hopeful for our next European adventure when we'll definitely explore those places!
